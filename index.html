Technology should help us, but many apps are made to keep us hooked. Use this guide to understand how your phone affects you and find simple ways to build better habits by the renewal of our minds. We must recognize that people are not just using tools...they are being used by them! These platforms are engineered to bypass the conscious mind and hack the human brain for profit. To move from a culture of digital secrecy to one of authentic presence, we require a structured, church-led intervention. This is the heart of the "Church Without Curtains" movement: pulling back the veil of digital dependency to reveal the person God intended us to be

summary: 'The "Pocket Casino" has removed all travel time and closing hours from betting, creating a highly addictive trance-like state. For a long time, I treated sports betting like it was just a way to make the game more interesting, but it turned into something much darker. I found myself chasing that one big parlay to fix our finances or to give me a win when work felt like a grind. The science tells us our brains actually get a bigger hit of dopamine from the "maybe" than the actual win. We get hooked on the "near-miss," thinking we’re just one lucky break away from everything being okay. But the truth is, I was trading my family’s security for a digital rush.',

                summary: 'Driven by Anonymity, Accessibility, and Affordability, mobile devices provide a high-speed engine for compulsive content consumption. If you feel like you’re losing your taste for real life, We want you to know you aren’t alone. You aren't a project to be fixed; you have been caught in a chemical loop. But we don't have to stay in the dark. In a Church Without Curtains, we are building a bridge from shame back to grace. We recognize that the screen is often just a symptom of a deeper squeeze.....maybe you're feeling powerless, lonely, or just plain tired. But you don't have to fight this alone.',
